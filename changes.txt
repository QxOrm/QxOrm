Changes in version 1.4.3:
- Support CMake : new CMakeLists.txt file added to build QxOrm library with CMake
- Improve SQL error messages when qx::dao functions return a database error
- New parameter in singleton class qx::QxSqlDatabase to log SQL bound values (setTraceSqlBoundValues) : by default, bound values are logged when an error occurred
- New syntax to select columns to not fetch : -{ col_1, col_2, etc... }
- New function qx::dao::call_query_without_prepare() to execute specific SQL queries without prepared statement
- Improve QxModelView module : all QxOrm models (based on qx::IxModel interface) can be serialized to JSON format (including all relationships levels) : this is now another way to work with relationships and QML (thanks to JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() javascript functions) without using nested models concept (so without using QxEntityEditor model/view generated classes)
- Improve qxBlogModelView sample project and QxOrm manual to show how to access to relationships data in QML (nested models or JSON)
- Fix a memory leak in qx::QxSqlRelation class
- Reduce output binary size (~20%) and compilation times (~20%) to build persistent classes based on QxOrm library
- Support unity build concept to reduce compilation times to build QxOrm library and C++ persistent classes generated by QxEntityEditor application : for more details, see _QX_UNITY_BUILD compilation option in QxOrm.pri or QxOrm.cmake configuration file
- Improve QxConvert module : possibility to store in database complex QVariant properties which contain QVariantMap, QVariantHash or QVariantList types (JSON format)
- Fix an issue with some databases when a foreign key is also a part of the primary key
- Fix an issue with QSharedPointer and boost::serialization when a same raw pointer is shared by several QSharedPointer during deserialization process

Changes in version 1.4.2:
- Support JSON serialization : each C++ class registered in QxOrm context can be serialized/deserialized in JSON format (JSON feature requires Qt5)
- For more details about JSON serialization, read QxOrm manual here : http://www.qxorm.com/qxorm_en/manual.html#manual_606
- With JSON serialization and QxService module : it is now possible to create REST Web Services to send data to a javascript engine (web pages for example)
- Fix some compilation errors with recent (and less permissive) compilers and latest versions of boost and Qt
- Fix relationship initialization assertion with complex, deep and circular relationships in large database schema
- Improve QDataStream serialization : should be faster now and fix an issue with circular instances dependencies
- Fix a bug fetching 1-n and n-n relationships when root is a container of stack objects (it worked only with pointers or smart-pointers, for example : QList<blog> vs QList<std::shared_ptr<blog>>)
- Improve qx::dump() function : possibility to display a C++ instance state in XML or JSON format

Changes in version 1.4.1:
!!! IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THIS VERSION !!! : it is strongly recommended to read the QxOrm.pri configuration file of this new version (compilation options have changed compared to previous versions).
Now, by default, QxOrm library is a much lighter library : QxOrm depends only on QtCore and QtSql (boost serialization is now optional and not required by default).
By default, serialization engine is now based on Qt QDataStream class (but you can still enable boost serialization defining _QX_ENABLE_BOOST_SERIALIZATION compilation option in QxOrm.pri configuration file).
So now, with default options :
- QxOrm 1.4.1 is much easier to install because you don't have to deal with boost serialization extra dependency ;
- QxOrm 1.4.1 shared library is 3X smaller than 1.3.2 version ;
- Generated binaries which depends on QxOrm library are 25% smaller ;
- If you are not using serialization functions in current projects based on QxOrm library, then you can define or not _QX_ENABLE_BOOST_SERIALIZATION compilation option without changing any line of your source code.

Here are all other changes of version 1.4.1:
- Improve relationships engine : possibility to select columns to fetch using syntax : my_relation { col_1, col_2, etc... }
- Improve QxTraits module to reduce compilation times and build smaller binaries
- Improve QxOrm website adding possibility to search and replacing the old FAQ by a more organized manual (user guide)
- New compilation option _QX_ENABLE_BOOST_SERIALIZATION to enable boost serialization dependency (read QxOrm.pri configuration file for more details)
- New compilation option _QX_ENABLE_QT_NETWORK to enable QxService module (transfer persistent layer over network) : read QxOrm.pri configuration file for more details
- New compilation option _QX_NO_RTTI to build QxOrm library without C++ RTTI type information
- Support QDataStream Qt serialization engine (used by default when _QX_ENABLE_BOOST_SERIALIZATION compilation option is not defined)
- Improve qx_query class (SQL queries) : new method (named customOperator()) which gives the possibility to define a custom operator (for example <@ for PostgreSQL ltree type)
- Fix a program startup issue due to 'static initialization order fiasco' creating singletons (it was an issue with some compilers during the shared library link process)
- New namespace qx::dao::throwable : same functions as qx::dao namespace, but they throw a qx::dao::sql_error exception when a SQL error occurred (instead of returning a QSqlError instance)
- Add a qAssertMsg() macro to put a more explicit error message when throwing an assertion
- Include all *.inl files (template implementation) in QxOrm.pro project file : QtCreator can now index these *.inl files in its project treeview
- Rename QxStringCvt to QxConvert : so if you persist custom types to database, you have to rename from QxStringCvt_FromVariant, QxStringCvt_ToVariant to QxConvert_FromVariant, QxConvert_ToVariant

Changes in version 1.3.2:
- Support C++11 types (need to set compilation options in QxOrm.pri config file to enable these features)
